                <p>
                    If you can't find clams, use mussels. If someone doesn't care for 
                    clams, double up on the shrimp and/or scallops. Baking times may 
                    vary according to the ingredients you select.
                </p>

                    <li>32 large cherry tomatoes</li>
                    <li>8 12x12-inch squares aluminum foil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly 
                        oil the grate. Mix the butter with lemon peel in a bowl.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Spread out the sheets of foil onto a flat work surface, 
                        and place 4 clams, 4 shrimp, 4 scallops, 4 pieces of corn 
                        on the cob, and 4 cherry tomatoes in the center of each 
                        piece of foil. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of lemon-butter mixture 
                        over the seafood and vegetables. Bring two opposite ends 
                        of a foil sheet together and fold over several times to seal. 
                        Leave room for steam. Fold the remaining ends over several 
                        times to seal the packet completely.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Place the foil packets on the preheated grill, 
                        cover the grill, and bake until the clams are 
                        open and the shrimp are pink and opaque, 15 to 20 
                        minutes (open a packet a little to take a peek).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        To serve, place a foil packet on a plate, cut a diagonal 
                        X through the foil, and peel back the foil. Garnish each 
                        packet with about 1/2 teaspoon of chives.
                    </li>
